## ðŸ’ª Challenges and Solutions
  - Understanding the project architecture: It was my first time dealing with such a large-scale project. It was challenging to piece everything together, comprehend the interrelation of each part, and integrate them effectively. However, with consistent effort, extensive research, and consultations with seasoned professionals, I managed to establish a suitable structure. Furthermore, grappling with Spring Security proved to be a formidable task. Despite the complexity, I eventually grasped its configuration for application integration. While encountering significant challenges, I must acknowledge that creating this project was an immensely gratifying experience. I eagerly look forward to further opportunities for practice and refinement.
